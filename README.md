This project has been supported by the Australian National
Data Service (ANDS) and the Australian Urban Research
Infrastructure Network (AURIN) through the National
Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy Program and
the Education Investment Fund (EIF) Super Science
Initiative. It is presented as an open-source software
tool for identifying urban employment clusters. The tool will be accessible to
anyone with a suitably-appointed computer and internet
access through the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure
Network (AURIN).  The purpose of developing this tool was to
create a means by which governments and researchers could
examine spatial employment clustering in metropolitan
regions in Australia in much finer spatial units than are
currently supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
